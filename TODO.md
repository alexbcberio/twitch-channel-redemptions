- [ ] Mutear al streamer (mutea el micro desde el OBS)
- [ ] Sudo: ..., lot of points. Forces to the streamer to do something, special animation. It appears a terminal in the screen starting a ssh session using a certificate (simulate the welcome screen), once logged in it simulates the user writing each character with a small delay between them (random delay), then the user presses enter and its prompt for the "sudo password" enters it and the terminal keeps open for a certain amount of time (random), finally "logout" is written and the session is ended. All the times the user has to write play a keypress sound effecft (also multiple ones will be recorded and used depending on the amount of characters in the specific word being written)
